     contact MSC Technical Support to report it.
  
     Features tagged for removal:
     - P-elements
     - SOL 600 nonlinear solution sequence
     - Unstructured one- and two-digit solution sequences (e.g. SOL 3, SOL 24)
     - SOL 190 (DBTRANS)
     - TAUCS solver
     - MSGMESH
     - Obsolete DMAP modules
