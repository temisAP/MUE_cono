     contact MSC Technical Support to report it.
  
     Features tagged for removal:
     - P-elements
     - SOL 600 nonlinear solution sequence
     - Unstructured one- and two-digit solution sequences (e.g. SOL 3, SOL 24)
     - SOL 190 (DBTRANS)
     - TAUCS solver
     - MSGMESH
     - Obsolete DMAP modules

     MAXITR*10 iterations have been implemented to remove the penetration.
     Based on the current convergence rate, it is estimated that it may take more than 10000 additional iterations to remove the pene
     tration.
     Therefore the job is stopped. If you want to allow the run to continue, set SYSTEM cell 756 to 0.
