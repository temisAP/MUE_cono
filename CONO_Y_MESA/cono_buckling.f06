 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 8146 (MCN1GCK)
     General glue and touching contact is only supported in SOL 101, 400, and 600.
     For other solution sequnces, only permanent glue contact is supported.
     IGLUE > 0 must be set to each entry in the BCONPRG in the very first STEP (loadcase).
 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 8147 (MCN1INIS)
     Deformable-to-rigid permanently-glued contact is not supported for velocity or position controlled rigids.
     User Action: Run a general contact with the glued as an option or use load controlled rigids with SPC's for
     the load-controlled grid points.
